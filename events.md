## Banquet at Restaurant Tårnet (19:00 - 21:30)

Restaurant Tårnet is located inside the tower of Christiansborg Palace, where the walking tour ends. With its 106 metres, the Christiansborg Palace tower is the highest in Copenhagen and offers a magnificent view of the city's rooftops. It is free to access the tower. There is a lift from the entrance to the top of the tower. The observation tower is just above the restaurant, which means that you can take the lift up to the top and overlook Copenhagen before or during your dinner.
